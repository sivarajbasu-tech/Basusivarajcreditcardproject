# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.  
The dataset is highly imbalanced, which reflects real-world banking fraud scenarios.

---

## Objective
- Detect fraudulent transactions
- Handle imbalanced data
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

---

## Dataset
- 280,000+ credit card transactions
- Features are anonymized using PCA
- Target column:
  - 0 → Normal transaction
  - 1 → Fraud transaction

---

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Train-test split
- Logistic Regression model
- Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## Result
The model focuses on identifying fraud transactions by prioritizing recall over accuracy.
